# Bug: Revolution or Love.

## Introductory
I've been dreaming of trying myself at gamedev for a long time and now the right moment has come :) This is my "first work in GameDev". Thanks to GameJam and Godot.
The project was started as an educational one for me, my daughter and her friend, as well as to close their school year project :), and of course for the fan, at least that was the case at the very beginning.

I immediately apologize for my English :)

## About the game:
This is a game about a mutant cyber beetle grown in the depths of a secret laboratory. A young laboratory scientist stayed in the laboratory at night trying to stimulate the mutation that had begunâ€¦ And then it begins....

The game has a simple multiplayer on WebSocket <br>
The main game is for a bug, but another player can connect for a scientist. All instructions are in the game itself.<br>
The game consists of 2 stages:<br>
Stage 1 is a beetle escapes and collects chebureks, and a scientist catches a beetle. It's more interesting to play with a friend than with AI , since he is stupid : ( <br>
Stage 2 is more combative <br>





## Thanks
Many thanks to my wife for helping. To my brother and the guys at work :) for your support<br>

1 At the beginning of the project, I decided to use a map made in a special Dungeon Painter prog, a good program I use it for DnD maps. But then I needed separate sprites and eventually I made the tiles myself, practiced working in krita (and did everything wrong :( ), and took the objects from Dungeon Painter. So I do not know yet whether I did the right thing or not, whether I had the right to do it or not. It seems that this game is opensource, does not bring commercial profit, is made as an education ... everything should be OK.<br>
2 the sounds are part from the Internet, some were recorded by themselves<br>
3 pictures and some sprites are also from the Internet<br>
